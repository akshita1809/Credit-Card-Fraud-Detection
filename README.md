# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning  

## Abstract  
Credit card fraud is a significant global issue, with billions of dollars lost annually. This project leverages machine learning to detect fraudulent transactions by identifying patterns indicative of fraud. Fraud can involve either the physical loss of a credit card or the theft of sensitive credit card information. By training machine learning models on historical transaction data, this project aims to build a system capable of identifying fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.

## Overview  
The rapid increase in credit card usage globally has highlighted the importance of ensuring security and safeguarding customers' sensitive information. According to credit card statistics from 2021, the number of credit card users worldwide reached 2.8 billion in 2019, with 70% of users owning a single card. Reports indicate that:  
- Credit card fraud incidents in the U.S. rose by 44.7% in 2020.  
- Account fraud (new accounts created by identity thieves) increased by 48% in 2020.  
- Fraud involving stolen credit card information rose by 9% in 2020.  

These alarming statistics motivated us to address this issue analytically by employing various machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions within large datasets.

## Project Goals  
The primary objective of this project is to detect fraudulent credit card transactions to prevent customers from being charged for unauthorized purchases. Specifically, the project aims to:  
1. Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions.  
2. Compare the performance of these models to identify the most effective method.  
3. Provide visualizations and numerical results to support the findings.  
4. Explore previous research and techniques to improve fraud detection systems.

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project was retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), containing transaction data from European credit card users over two days in 2013.  

The dataset provides a reliable foundation for building machine learning models for fraud detection.

## Algorithms  
To achieve the project goals, the following machine learning algorithms were implemented:  
1. **K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN):** A simple yet effective algorithm for identifying fraudulent patterns based on proximity in feature space.  
2. **Logistic Regression (LR):** A statistical method to model the probability of a transaction being fraudulent.  
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A robust classifier that separates fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions by maximizing the margin between data points.  
4. **Decision Tree (DT):** A tree-based algorithm that classifies transactions based on decision rules inferred from the data.  

Each algorithm was evaluated and compared to identify the best-performing model.

## Results  
The models were trained on the dataset and evaluated using standard performance metrics. Among the four models, **KNN** and **Decision Tree** achieved the highest accuracy (100%) in detecting fraudulent transactions. This demonstrates the effectiveness of these models in improving customer satisfaction and ensuring secure credit card transactions.

## Conclusion  
This project successfully implemented and compared multiple machine learning techniques to detect credit card fraud. The models developed achieved excellent accuracy, particularly **KNN** and **Decision Tree**, which performed the best. These results demonstrate the potential of machine learning to enhance fraud detection systems, ultimately improving customer trust and satisfaction.
